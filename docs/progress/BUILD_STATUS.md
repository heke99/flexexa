# Flexexa build status and ordered gates

Updated: 2026-09-09. This is an evidence ledger, not a percentage-complete estimate.

## Current phase: 0 — in progress

| Boundary | Evidence / state |
|---|---|
| Canonical core database | PR #5 merged into foundation; schema parity and 70 DB assertions verified. |
| Tenant-owned roles and temporal authorization | PR #6 merged as `52026db9095b8ea174eac4cd1c7d69d73947c34d`; final run `34355760089` passed 105 DB assertions; exact dev migration checksum matched; 12 additional live assertions passed with rollback; security advisors clean. |
| Canonical TypeScript and real quality gates | PR #4 merged as `bdd0b2674aed026196d69a3349225ea1f2d8577d`; synchronized run `34356606525` passed frozen install, lint, typecheck, tests, build and DB replay. |
| Transactional core writes | Implemented for review in the current change; isolated SQL replay, shared-contract and real concurrency verification required before promotion/merge. |
| Own Enode-like platform plus Enode adapter | Binding design: ADR-0001. Provider registry/link/control-route implementation still required; no live device integration claimed. |
| Rules/policy | Deterministic primitives exist; full versioned registry, publishing, approval and readiness are not finished. |
| AWS | Bootstrap/state/OIDC documented. Normal application resources have not been applied by this change. No claim of running ECS/RabbitMQ/Valkey/ClickHouse. |
| UI/deployment | Next.js shell and preview builds exist; no end-to-end smart charging UI or production readiness. |
| Remaining foundation | Scoped service/client authentication, approval/break-glass, outbox publisher, provider architecture, country packs, observability, Docker/runtime dependencies, infrastructure verification and restore/security/load gates. |

## Sequential continuation
Complete and verify the current core write boundary. Then provider-neutral connectivity schema/adapters and central policy/readiness; finish runtime infrastructure and full Phase 0 gates before claiming the foundation complete. Each PR preserves prior tests and migrations. No destructive history rewrite, no skipping failed gates, no silent tenant/schema/contract divergence.

The locked phase sequence remains: 1 smart charging MVP; 2 full Swedish true cost; 3 direct connector expansion; 4 flex shadow; 5 BSP pilot; 6 multi-BSP; 7 local flex; 8 solar/battery/HEMS; 9 Edge/OEM; 10 licensed Nord Pool data; 11 country expansion; 12 direct BSP readiness; 13 V2G. These later phases remain planned, not delivered.

External vendor credentials, device/protocol qualification, commercial data rights and market-role approvals must be recorded as external gates. Simulators and code interfaces are not substitutes for successful live verification. No real bids, settlement money or physical commands until their corresponding safety/authorization gates pass.
